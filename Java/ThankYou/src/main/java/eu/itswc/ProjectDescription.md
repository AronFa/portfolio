###  THANK YOU

1. **background**
It is clear that part of the modern human to human relations quite often rely on technology. If i miss friend,
i can write them a message or call them. If i want to show something, i'll probably end up sending a link. If i'm
feeling uncertain if what i'm saying is actually true, i can almost certainly find it out in minutes. But every
now and then a strangers goes out of their way to do an act so kind that i feel obligated to or say something but
nothing seems adept. It makes me want to be a better person, but i also want to do something then an there.

2. **concept**
The project  consist of a small, coin-like tokens that can easily in a wallet and then, when you encounter an strangers
unexpected act of kindness you give them the coin and then register the act on a website. And everybody who at one
point received the token would have access to the full history of the token.

3. **details**
To make it work all tokens should be durable and be equipped with an ID (unique to the token) and URL, while also being
easily distinguishable from coins at first glace to avoid giving the token looking like giving money. The linked web
page should only introduce the project, and once the tokens ID is registered it should display only the very last
entry of the series of kind acts: the one for witch the current owner got it (naturally after the previous owner
writes it). To full history only becomes accessible once the current owner has given the token to someone else
and written the entry on it. After that there could be a way to get 'fresh' tokens, but i don't think that anyone
should have full access to all the tokens and their history.

4. **back-end**
While learning about Spring i realized that this project -that i had in mind for years, and that i plan to do
regardless of the career switch- happens to be a perfect starter Spring project. It handles CRUD operations it has
users with different levels of data access. And it's motivating.
