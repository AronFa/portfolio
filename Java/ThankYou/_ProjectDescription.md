###  THANK YOU

1. **background**
It is clear that technology plays a key part in our everyday human to human interactions.  We seem to have tasked it to enhance and extend our communication even in our personal lives. If i miss friend, i can write them a message or call them. If i want to show something, i'll probably end up sending a link. If i'm feeling uncertain if what i'm saying is actually true, i can almost certainly find it out in minutes. But every now and then something happens that calls for action, but even with all our inventions we just stand dumbstruck without an idea what to do. This project revolves around one of these phenomenon: the one when we see a surprising act of selfless kindness. A stranger makes sure that a fragile looking elder gets home safe in the suddenly icy conditions. An observant passenger hurries to return a wallet to the owner who got off the bus without it. Someone stops their vehicle and gets out to make sure a blind pedestrian crosses the road safely. There seems to be a particular, unanswerable, strong, yet somehow vague call for action associated with these actions.

2. **concept**
The idea is to have a set of a small, coin-like tokens that are passed to the person who acts surprisingly kind. The token itself has all the necessary information on it so that the new bearer has access to it's history: the chain of events concluding with the act they themselves done. And now that they are the current bearer it is their turn to give it so someone.

3. **details**
**i.)** The tokens themselves should be **easy to keep on person**, something like a coin. They should be durable and be equipped with an ID (unique to the token) and URL(shared), while also being easily distinguishable from coins at first glace (to avoid giving the token looking like offering money). 
**ii.)** The linked web page should introduce the project, and upon **entering the id reveal the history of the held token**. And then - after the previous owner registers the act for which the current owner was given the token, allow the current bearer add to the thread after they have passed it.
**iii.)** **No one should have access to history of all tokens**, just the ones they at one point have held.
**iv.)** Optionally, there could be a link to **get new tokens** after the user has written their reviews if they want to start new records of kind event threads (to which they than would have access to see).

4. **back-end**
While learning about Spring i realized that this project -that i had in mind for years- is a perfect Spring Boot starter project. It handles CRUD operations, has users with different levels of data access. And the fact that i wanted to do it anyways is a source of motivation.
