# This is my coding portfolio as of 2020.12.01

It contains some Python 3 code written for the Udacity course 'Data Structures and Algorithms'. The main point to acquire the ability to design software with complexity in mind (see syllabus for details). This was taught through exercises, some of the more interesting ones I've made available for viewing in the Python folder. Please note that that was my first dive into programming.

Having acquired a base for further learning I've decided to continue my studies in coding by learning back-end software engineering, but there did not seem to be any online course available with a comprehensive back end syllabus (they all seemed to focus on only small parts of it). So I've reached out to an ex high school classmate to help me put together such a syllabus (see in the Java folder) aspiring to be comparable to junior level requirements (I'm on Lesson 8 now). The project I've included in in the Java folder is a personal project i mean to realize regardless of my plan to become a software engineer (for a more detailed description look for Java/ThankYou/_ProjectDescription.md).
